# Welcome to your Frontend Engineering Challenge


## Challenge Overview

In this challenge we’ll focus on your Frontend and problem solving skills. Here are 3 challenges to work on, you can pick 2 and evolve the current project.

1. Fix the sort by implementation in the Header component so that we can filter by status completed
2. Create a load more button that loads 10 more results
3. Refactor the Todo component and sniff out the code smells



## How to get started

Head to this [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/engineering-assignment-487bnf) repository, fork it and start working on your solutions. Once you are finished, send us an email with the URL of your forked code sandbox.

## What we’ll be looking for:
- Good code: make sure the code is well written for humans, is easily testable and scalable.
- Good architecture for your components and the overall project structure.
- Frontend expertise: show us that you know how to use React effectively and don’t neglect the HTML/CSS part. Think about different devices, their screen sizes, input methods, network conditions. 
- How you think about the code you put on a shared codebase (document your changes on your PR)

## What we’re not looking for:
- No old browser compatibility (you can use modern features (like css grids and native lazy loading))
- No state management library

## Good luck!
