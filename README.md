## Challenge Overview
In this challenge we’ll focus on your Frontend and problem solving skills. Here are 3 challenges to work on, you can pick 2 and evolve the current project.

1. Fix the sort by implementation in the Header component so that we can sort todos by status completed
2. Create a load more button that loads 10 more results
3. Refactor the Todo component and sniff out the code smells


## How to get started
Head to this [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/frontend-engineering-assignment-r9vcxr) repository, fork it and start working on your solutions. We estimate that the challenge shouldn't take more than 2 hours and we are expecting to see the results within the next 7 days


## What we’ll be looking for:
- We want you to approach those challenges as regular feature tickets. That means that you have full ownership on making decisions regarding your features (documentation, comments, tests etc).
- Good code: make sure the code is well written for humans and is scalable.
- Good architecture for your components and the overall project structure.
- Frontend expertise: show us that you know how to use React effectively and don’t neglect the HTML/CSS part. Think about different devices, their screen sizes, input methods, network conditions.


## What we’re not looking for:
- No old browser compatibility (you can use modern features (like css grids and native lazy loading))
- No state management library


## Once you're done
Once you are finished, send us via email a short explanation of the work you did as well as the URL of your forked codesandbox.

## Good luck!
